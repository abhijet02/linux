To clear the pagecache, dentries, and inodes, you can use the following command, 

sudo sync; echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches 

or

sudo sync; sudo sysctl -w vm.drop_caches=3



If you're experiencing DNS-related issues, clear the DNS cache:
sudo systemd-resolve --flush-caches

For nscd (Name Service Cache Daemon):
sudo systemctl restart nscd



diagnose webfilter fortiguard statistics flush


Ok, another attempt; under System->Maintenance->FortiGuardCenter->WebFiltering there' s a box to fill with TTL for WF caching. Default value when enabled is 3600 seg This means that your FGT will store URL ratings in the cache for 1 hour without contact Fguard servers again (or until newer cache entries force the removal of the older ones) What about to change that value to force expiration?
