Step 1: Create a file named tomcat6 in your /etc/init.d directory
$ cd /etc/init.d
$ gedit tomcat6

Step 2: Copy the following script and save the file
#!/bin/bash
# chkconfig: 2345 80 20
# Description: Tomcat Server basic start/shutdown script
# /etc/init.d/tomcat6 -- startup script for the Tomcat 6 servlet engine

TOMCAT_HOME=/usr/local/apache-tomcat-6.0.35/bin
START_TOMCAT=/usr/local/apache-tomcat-6.0.35/bin/startup.sh
STOP_TOMCAT=/usr/local/apache-tomcat-6.0.35/bin/shutdown.sh

start() {
 echo -n "Starting tomcat6: "
 cd $TOMCAT_HOME
 ${START_TOMCAT}
 echo "done."
}

stop() {
 echo -n "Shutting down tomcat6: "
 cd $TOMCAT_HOME
 ${STOP_TOMCAT}
 echo "done."
}

case "$1" in
 
start)
 start
 ;;

stop)
 stop
 ;;

restart)
 stop
 sleep 10
 start
 ;;

*)
 echo "Usage: $0 {start|stop|restart}"

esac
exit 0

Change the settings for the chkconfig based on your requirements. In a scenario where Apache Web server is in the front of Tomcat server with MySQL database usually the startup sequence should be MySQL then Tomcat and Apache Web Server in last. Also make sure you change the TOMCAT_HOME, START_TOMCAT and STOP_TOMCAT variables based on your Tomcat Install.

Step 3: Update the file permissions to make it executable by any user
$ chmod 755 tomcat6

Step 4: Make sure you have chkconfig command installed
$ chkconfig --helpotherwise just install it
$ sudo apt-get install chkconfig
 
Step 5: Run chkconfig command to add the script to the startup services
$ chkconfig --add tomcat6

Basically the chkconfig command automatically adds the symbolic links for starting and stopping the service based on the paramaters passed to it. Here is the list of links created from the above link. You can run the find command to check.
$ find . -name "*tomcat6"

Response from the above command ...
./rc.d/init.d/tomcat6
./rc.d/rc4.d/S80tomcat6
./rc.d/rc3.d/S80tomcat6
./rc.d/rc6.d/K20tomcat6
./rc.d/rc5.d/S80tomcat6
./rc.d/rc2.d/S80tomcat6
./rc.d/rc0.d/K20tomcat6
./rc.d/rc1.d/K20tomcat6

Step 6: Make sure scripts got added to the startup services
Type the following command on the Terminal
$ chkconfig --list tomcat6
Response should be something like this
tomcat6         0:off   1:off   2:on    3:on    4:on    5:on    6:off
 
Step 7: Verify your service is working
To start the Tomcat server
$ service tomcat start
To stop the Tomcat server
$ service tomcat stop
