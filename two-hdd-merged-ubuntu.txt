Merging two separate hard disk drives (HDDs) into one drive on Ubuntu can be achieved by creating a Logical Volume Group (LVM) that combines the storage space of the two drives. Here are the steps to merge two separate HDDs into one drive on Ubuntu:

Connect both HDDs to your Ubuntu computer.

Open a terminal window by pressing "Ctrl + Alt + T".

Install the LVM package by typing the following command and pressing Enter:

arduino
Copy code

sudo apt-get install lvm2

List the available disks by typing the following command and pressing Enter:

Copy code
sudo fdisk -l
Note the names of the two HDDs that you want to merge. They will be listed under the "Disk" section.

Create a new Physical Volume (PV) for each disk by typing the following command for each HDD and pressing Enter:

bash
Copy code
sudo pvcreate /dev/sdX
Replace "X" with the appropriate letter for each disk.

Create a new Volume Group (VG) that includes both disks by typing the following command and pressing Enter:

bash
Copy code
sudo vgcreate <VG_name> /dev/sdX /dev/sdY
Replace "<VG_name>" with the name you want to give the Volume Group, and "X" and "Y" with the appropriate letters for each disk.

Create a new Logical Volume (LV) for the combined space by typing the following command and pressing Enter:

php
Copy code
sudo lvcreate -l 100%FREE -n <LV_name> <VG_name>
Replace "<LV_name>" with the name you want to give the Logical Volume, and "<VG_name>" with the name you gave the Volume Group.

Format the new Logical Volume with a file system of your choice, such as ext4 or NTFS, by typing the following command and pressing Enter:

php
Copy code
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/<VG_name>/<LV_name>
Replace "<VG_name>" and "<LV_name>" with the names you gave the Volume Group and Logical Volume, respectively.

Mount the new drive by creating a mount point and then mounting the new file system to it. For example, to mount the new file system to a directory called "/mnt/mydrive", type the following commands and press Enter:

bash
Copy code
sudo mkdir /mnt/mydrive
sudo mount /dev/<VG_name>/<LV_name> /mnt/mydrive
Replace "<VG_name>" and "<LV_name>" with the names you gave the Volume Group and Logical Volume, respectively.

Congratulations, you have successfully merged two separate HDDs into one drive on Ubuntu using LVM!
